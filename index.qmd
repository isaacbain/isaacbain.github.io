## Welcome to my personal website.

This is where I share my projects, maps, graphs, and code that I’ve been tinkering with. You'll hopefully find some interesting content here about environmental data, freshwater ecology, and public health.

Please remember, nothing here represents the views of my employer—it's all just my personal work and thoughts. My goal is to make complex data more accessible and even a bit fun. I aim to provide insights and provoke thought rather than deliver definitive conclusions.

I hope you find something intriguing and valuable on my site. Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.

Ngā mihi,

Isaac Bain
