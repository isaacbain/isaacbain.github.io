## Introduction

With the Aratere ferry once again playing bumper boats during docking, and the dream of a bridge or tunnel across the Cook Strait sinking faster than a lead balloon, it’s clear we need a new approach. So, let’s toss conventional wisdom overboard and consider something truly bold: draining the Cook Strait to create a land route between the North and South Islands.

Yes, you read that right.

## Extending SH1

**Scenic Route: Paraparaumu to Nelson**

Armed with some bathymetric data and a healthy dose of dystopian satire, I've mapped out the potential routes for our new inter-island highway. The first scenario, perfect for those who love a scenic drive, proposes draining a moderate depth of water to establish a route between Paraparaumu and Nelson. It’s a bit longer, sure, but think of the coastal views!

**Speedy Shortcut: Wellington to Blenheim**

Alternatively, if you're in a hurry to get from Wellington to Blenheim, we can opt to drain a greater depth of water for a more direct route. Picture it: a swift, straight drive through what was once ocean. Just watch out for the occasional leftover fish.

## Beyond Cook Strait

Of course, this raises the question: where else should we drain next? Perhaps a road trip to the Chatham Islands is in order? Imagine cruising along the ocean floor, past ancient shipwrecks and submerged ecosystems, all the way to your holiday destination.

In a world of endless possibilities—and an endless supply of satire—draining the Cook Strait might just be the wacky, out-of-the-box solution we've been searching for. So, what do you think? Time to roll up our sleeves and start digging?
