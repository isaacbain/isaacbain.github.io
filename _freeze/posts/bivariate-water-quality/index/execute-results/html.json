However, many areas in New Zealand are not meeting our communities' expectations and require improvement.[^1] Knowing where to target efforts to improve water quality is crucial, and a solid understanding of pressures is needed.\n\n[^1]: <https://environment.govt.nz/publications/our-freshwater-2023/>\n\nFor management actions to be effective, they should be based on predictive relationships between land use, stressor levels in receiving waters, and the ecological and cultural responses to these stressors.[^2] Land use intensity is consistently identified as a key pressure on water quality in New Zealand. In both process-based and statistical models predicting water quality, land use is a significant predictor of *E. coli* and nitrogen concentrations.\n\n[^2]: Scott T.

This is well-suited for visualisation using a bivariate colour scale.\n\nOf course, this will be an exploration of just one of many interacting pressures determining the state of water quality. This technique allows exploring two variables at once, but trivariate maps would be almost impossible to interpret!\n\nExploring more than two variables at a time may require moving to a full modelling approach and looking at plots like [Partial Dependence Plots](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/partial_dependence.html) (PDP) or [**SH**apley **A**dditive ex**P**lanations](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-shap-values-to-explain-how-your-machine-learning-model-works-732b3f40e137) (SHAP) values.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Show libraries code\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(mapview)\nlibrary(koordinatr)\nlibrary(biscale)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\ncustom_pal4 <- c(\n  \"1-1\" = \"#f2f2f2\", # low x, low y #ffffff\n  \"2-1\" = \"#b9ddff\",\n  \"3-1\" = \"#64bbff\",\n  \"4-1\" = \"#0295ff\", # high x, low y\n  \"1-2\" = \"#fedcb7\",\n  \"2-2\" = \"#b8b8b8\",\n  \"3-2\" = \"#6691bb\",\n  \"4-2\" = \"#0069ba\",\n  \"1-3\" = \"#ffb869\",\n  \"2-3\" = \"#b89168\",\n  \"3-3\" = \"#676767\",\n  \"4-3\" = \"#003867\",\n  \"1-4\" = \"#ff9400\", # low x, high y\n  \"2-4\" = \"#bb6800\",\n  \"3-4\" = \"#693800\",\n  \"4-4\" = \"#000000\" # high x, high y\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## A Primer on Bivariate Maps\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Example of bivariate colour scale grid.](index_files/figure-html/fig-pal-1.png){#fig-pal width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBivariate colour scale maps are thematic maps that use two different colour scales to simultaneously display two variables on the same map. This approach allows for the visualisation of the relationship between the two variables across a geographic space. Each colour on the map represents a unique combination of the two variables' values.\n\nTypically, one colour gradient is represented on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. The intersection of these gradients results in a grid of colours, each representing a different combination of the two variables' values (@fig-pal).\n\nFor example, here's a bivariate map of COVID-19 case and death rates in the USA (@fig-covid).[^4]\n\n[^4]: Maiti, Arabinda & Zhang, Qi & Sannigrahi, Srikanta & Pramanik, Suvamoy & Chakraborti, Suman & Cerdà, Artemi & Pilla, Francesco.

Sustainable Cities and Society. 68. 102784.\n\n![Bivariate choropleth map demonstrates the county wise distribution (per 10,000 population) of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 22 to July 26, 2020. From Maiti et al. 2021.](covid-map.png){#fig-covid width=\"500\"}\n\nYou can get a large amount of information from just this one map; you can see areas that had both low cases and death rates (doing very well), you can see areas that had an unexpectedly large number of deaths given a low number of cases (doing very poorly), you can see areas that had an unexpectedly low number of deaths given a high number of cases (doing quite well), etc.\n\nBut I'm interested in applying this to explore the relationship between livestock density and water quality.\n\n## Livestock vs Water Quality\n\n### Data sources\n\nThe data for stocking density, *E. coli*, and nitrogen (NNN) were obtained from the NIWA's latest report on spatial modelling of river water quality in New Zealand. This report utilised monitoring data from 2016 to 2020 to develop model-based predictions for approximately 590,000 unique river segments across the national river network. [The study utilised random forest models to predict water quality state. This method involves using an ensemble of regression trees to improve prediction accuracy and handle complex, non-linear relationships between predictors and response variables.]{.aside}\n\nSelected data used in this analysis includes:\n\n-   **Stocking Density**: Represented as the number of livestock units per hectare. Derived from the Agricultural Production Survey hex grids.\n-   ***E. coli***: Modelled concentrations measured in colony-forming units per 100 millilitres (cfu/100ml). *E. coli* serves as an indicator of faecal contamination in water bodies.\n-   **Nitrogen**: Modelled NNN concentrations measured in milligrams per litre (mg/L). Nitrogen levels are indicative of nutrient pollution, primarily from agricultural runoff.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Show data code\"}\n# water quality\n# ecoli_raw <- get_layer_as_sf(Sys.getenv(\"mfe_api_key\"), \"mfe\", \"109886\")\n# saveRDS(ecoli_raw, \"data/ecoli_raw.rds\")\necoli_raw <- readRDS(\"data/ecoli_raw.rds\")\n\necoli <- ecoli_raw |>\n  filter(mesrmnt == \"Median\") |>\n  select(nzsgmnt,\n    median_ecoli = value,\n    strm_rd\n  )\n\nrm(ecoli_raw)\n\n# nitrogen_raw <- get_layer_as_sf(Sys.getenv(\"mfe_api_key\"), \"mfe\", \"109888\")\n# saveRDS(nitrogen_raw, \"data/nitrogen_raw.rds\")\nnitrogen_raw <- readRDS(\"data/nitrogen_raw.rds\")\n\nnitrogen <- nitrogen_raw |>\n  filter(measr_b == \"NNN\") |>\n  select(nzsgmnt,\n    median_nitrogen = value\n  )\n\nrm(nitrogen_raw)\n\n# load predictors\nload(\"data/REC2.4_lcdb5_predictors.RData\")\nrm(ThesePredictors)\n\necoli |>\n  left_join(nitrogen |> st_drop_geometry(), by = join_by(nzsgmnt)) |>\n  left_join(REC2.4_predictors, by = c(\"nzsgmnt\" = \"nzsegment\")) |>\n  select(\n    nzsgmnt,\n    median_ecoli,\n    median_nitrogen,\n    PropDairy_2017,\n    PropSheep_2017,\n    SUDensityTotal_2017,\n    StreamOrder\n  ) |>\n  filter(StreamOrder > 1) |> \n  # filter extreme outliers \n  filter(SUDensityTotal_2017 < 40) -> dat\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Scatter plot\n\nLet's start by looking at the relationship between total stock density and median *E. coli* levels. There is a positive relationship between the two variables: areas with higher stock density tend to have higher *E. coli* levels (@fig-scatter-plot).\n\nHowever, the relationship is not perfect. Some areas have high stock density and low *E. coli* levels, and vice versa.

Likewise, livestock density is only one of many predictors that can be used to model water quality.
