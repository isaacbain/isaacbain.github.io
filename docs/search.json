This approach allows for the visualisation of the relationship between the two variables across a geographic space. Each colour on the map represents a unique combination of the two variables‚Äô values.\nTypically, one colour gradient is represented on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. The intersection of these gradients results in a grid of colours, each representing a different combination of the two variables‚Äô values (Figure¬†1).\nFor example, here‚Äôs a bivariate map of COVID-19 case and death rates in the USA (Figure¬†2).4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Bivariate choropleth map demonstrates the county wise distribution (per 10,000 population) of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 22 to July 26, 2020. From Maiti et al.¬†2021.\n\n\n\nYou can get a large amount of information from just this one map; you can see areas that had both low cases and death rates (doing very well), you can see areas that had an unexpectedly large number of deaths given a low number of cases (doing very poorly), you can see areas that had an unexpectedly low number of deaths given a high number of cases (doing quite well), etc.\nBut I‚Äôm interested in applying this to explore the relationship between livestock density and water quality."

    "text": "4 Livestock vs Water Quality\n\n4.1 Data sources\nThe data for stocking density, E. coli, and nitrogen (NNN) were obtained from the NIWA‚Äôs latest report on spatial modelling of river water quality in New Zealand. This report utilised monitoring data from 2016 to 2020 to develop model-based predictions for approximately 590,000 unique river segments across the national river network. The study utilised random forest models to predict water quality state. This method involves using an ensemble of regression trees to improve prediction accuracy and handle complex, non-linear relationships between predictors and response variables.\nSelected data used in this analysis includes:\n\nStocking Density: Represented as the number of livestock units per hectare. Derived from the Agricultural Production Survey hex grids.\nE. coli: Modelled concentrations measured in colony-forming units per 100 millilitres (cfu/100ml). E. coli serves as an indicator of faecal contamination in water bodies.\nNitrogen: Modelled NNN concentrations measured in milligrams per litre (mg/L).

Some areas have high stock density and low E. coli levels, and vice versa.

Using bivariate colour scale maps, we can visually explore these interactions and identify regions where specific patterns emerge.\nThis analysis only covered two water quality indicators, but the same approach can be used for other indicators, such as phosphorus or sediment. Likewise, livestock density is only one of many predictors that can be used to model water quality. Other predictors, such as urban land use, climate, and topography, can also be visualised in similar way to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between livestock density and water quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†11: Bivariate comparison of upstream livestock density and modelled E. coli concentration in river segments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†12: Bivariate comparison of upstream livestock density and modelled nitrogen concentration in river segments."

It includes several user-friendly features:\n\nHover to View Details: Users can hover over any point to see the hut‚Äôs name and a photo, making it easy to identify and learn more about each hut.\nClickable Points: Clicking on any point takes users directly to the Remote Huts website for detailed information about the hut.\nCustomizable Base Maps: Users can switch between different base maps, including terrain, Topographic 1:50k and 1:250k, and satellite views. This functionality, available via a control in the upper right corner, allows users to choose the most useful map type for their needs.\n\nThe interactive map is created using the leaflet package, which provides powerful tools for building interactive maps. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key steps:\n\nPopup Content: The hover popups display the hut‚Äôs name and image, generated using HTML content.\nClick Event: JavaScript is used to add click events to each point, linking to the corresponding hut page on the Remote Huts website.\nBase Layers: Various base map layers are added using addProviderTiles and addTiles, giving users multiple perspectives of the terrain.\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# column: screen-inset-shaded\n\n# create hover popup spec\ncontent &lt;- paste0(\"&lt;div style='text-align: center;'&gt;&lt;b&gt;\", df$Name, \"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\", \"&lt;img src = '\", df$Image, \"', width = '175'&gt;\")\n\n# goto url on click\njsCode &lt;- paste0('\n function(el, x, data) {\n  var markers = document.getElementsByClassName(\"leaflet-interactive\");\n  for(var i = 0; i &lt; markers.length; i++){\n    (function(){\n      var v = data.URL[i];\n      markers[i].addEventListener(\"click\", function() { window.open(v); }, false);\n    }()); \n  }\n }\n')\n\n# setup xyz tiles\ntopo50_tiles &lt;- paste0(\n  \"https://tiles-cdn.koordinates.com/services;key=\", Sys.getenv(\"koordinates_tile_api\"), \"/tiles/v4/layer=50767/EPSG:3857/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\"\n  )\n\ntopo250_tiles &lt;- paste0(\n  \"https://tiles-cdn.koordinates.com/services;key=\", Sys.getenv(\"koordinates_tile_api\"), \"/tiles/v4/layer=50798/EPSG:3857/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\"\n)\n\n# create leaflet map\nmap &lt;- \n  leaflet(df) %&gt;%\n  addMapPane(name = \"circles\", zIndex = 410) %&gt;%\n  addCircleMarkers(\n    color = \"black\",\n    fillColor = \"blue\",\n    radius = 5,\n    fillOpacity = 0.75, \n    stroke = T, \n    weight = 1,\n    opacity = 1,\n    label = lapply(content, htmltools::HTML),\n  ) %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Voyager, group = \"Terrain\") %&gt;%\n  addTiles(topo50_tiles, group = \"Topo50\") %&gt;%\n  addTiles(topo250_tiles, group = \"Topo250\") %&gt;%\n  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldImagery, group = \"Satellite\") %&gt;%\n  addLayersControl(\n    baseGroups = c(\"Terrain\", \"Topo250\", \"Topo50\", \"Satellite\"),\n    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  htmlwidgets::onRender(jsCode, data = df) \n\nmap"

Invercargill also shows similar seasonality, albeit at lower concentrations.\nLower Hutt remains well below the guideline all year-round, but exhibits reversed seasonality, with higher concentrations in summer. It‚Äôs worth noting that Lower Hutt is included in the top four due to a single large spike in 2022, so it might be reasonable to exclude this site from further analysis.\nMilton is particularly interesting as it has numerous exceedances during winter but appears not to monitor air quality during summer (this trend is true in other years as well)."

They are used in climate research to understand how social, economic, and environmental factors might evolve over the 21st century. There are five SSPs, each representing a different socio-economic development pathway:\n\nSSP1 - Sustainability (Taking the Green Road): This pathway envisions a world making a shift towards sustainability, emphasizing inclusive development and respect for environmental limits.\nSSP2 - Middle of the Road: This pathway assumes moderate socio-economic development without major shifts in economic trends or technological advancements.\nSSP3 - Regional Rivalry (A Rocky Road): This pathway describes a fragmented world with increasing nationalism, reduced international cooperation, and slow economic growth. Regional conflicts and challenges to sustainable development are more prevalent.\nSSP4 - Inequality (A Road Divided): This pathway highlights a world with increasing inequalities, both within and between countries, leading to uneven socio-economic development.\nSSP5 - Fossil-fueled Development (Taking the Highway): This pathway depicts rapid economic growth driven by a reliance on fossil fuels and energy-intensive lifestyles.\n\n\n\n2.2 RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways)\nThe RCPs are scenarios that include projections of future greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations based on different trajectories of GHG emissions. Each RCP represents a different level of radiative forcing (the change in energy in the atmosphere due to GHGs) by the year 2100, for example:\n\nRCP2.6: A scenario with low GHG emissions leading to a peak radiative forcing of around 2.6 W/m¬≤ before 2100, followed by a decline.\nRCP4.5: A scenario with intermediate GHG emissions leading to a stabilization of radiative forcing at around 4.5 W/m¬≤ by 2100.\nRCP6.0: Another intermediate scenario with radiative forcing reaching 6.0 W/m¬≤ by 2100.\nRCP8.5: A high GHG emissions scenario leading to radiative forcing reaching 8.5 W/m¬≤ by 2100."

The resulting visualisation not only highlights population patterns but also provides a visually striking representation of New Zealand‚Äôs demographic landscape.\nThe improvement in spatial resolution offered by this data could significantly enhance research applications. For instance, it enables more accurate distribution of populations onto river networks, allowing us to answer questions such as how many people live upstream of any given river segment.\nStay tuned for a future post on this topic."

LAWA provides a good fact sheet on what this metric means. In short:\n\nThe Trophic Level Index (TLI) is a method of characterising the ecological health of lakes based on the amount of nutrients and algae growing in them. It provides an integrated measure of water quality that can be tracked over time and that can be used to estimate biological productivity.

    "text": "Hi there! I‚Äôm a quantitative ecologist who loves working in environmental resource management. I dive into all sorts of tasks, from analysing raw data and generating insights, to developing policies, advising decision-makers, and building tools to help with implementation. I‚Äôm all about using open-source tools like R and making sure my analyses are reproducible.\nI call ≈åtautahi (Christchurch) home‚Äîa lovely little city. When I‚Äôm not working, you‚Äôll likely find me packrafting, paragliding, bikepacking, or sea kayaking.\nMost of my work focuses on freshwater ecosystems, but I‚Äôm also interested in how environmental health affects human health. I spend a lot of time at the intersection of science and policy, trying to bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.\nOn top of all that, I‚Äôm also a PhD candidate in Public Health at the University of Otago, continuing to learn and contribute to a new field."
